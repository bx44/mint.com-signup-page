# mint.com-signup-page
### by Barak Ben-Hamu

A clone of Mint.com's signup-page.

This is part of the HTML & CSS curriculum at Microverse using The Oding Project's lesson on Forms (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms).

The page consists of a simple Signup page, asking the user for personal info, and giving the ability to submmit it. It also contains the company's logo as well as some copyright info and navigation links in a footer.

The resources used on this page are all from mint.com.

A live version of the main development branch (first-dev) can be found at http://raw.githack.com/bx44/mint.com-signup-page/main-dev/index.html.
